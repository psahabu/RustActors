Akka style Typed Actors
	basically receivers of a library dispatch
Could library macro so that messages are matched on automatically
	dispatch to a method with the same name as the Message type

No need for Contexts or Stage (forget parent/children)
	message formatting can go into Agents
	
Can still use Futures for getting results.

Also could make a macro for "!" syntax
	agent ! msg
	results in agent.deliver(context.send(msg))
		implicitly calls context.send(msg)
		would require argument names to be mandated
		
Actors should be constructed as in Cage
	however, should receive &context so they can
